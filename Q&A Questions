In regards to the hash table problem - not the video -
  we're wondering where on the has table object the passed in values are stored. They get pushed to the
  storage array that is initialized as part of the pseudoclassical constructor function, but when we look at the
  instantiation of the HashTable object in the console after running the code, it's not apparent where the array actually exists.
  It's on the prototype, correct? How can you look at it?






What is the actual definition of a tuple? In this lecture / project we talk about a key:value pair as it's own
standalone array as a tuple, but the array of key value pairs is defined as a tuple as well?

How does the JS hashing function stack up next to encryption hash functions,
or say the hash functions used in blockchain ledgers?

How does the has table know which key to go to when it encounters a collision after hashing the key input?
